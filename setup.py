        This distribution provides WSGI middleware
        for "RESTful" mapping of URL paths to WSGI applications.
        Selector now also comes with components for environ based
        dispatch and on-the-fly middleware composition.
        There is a very simple optional mini-language for
        path expressions. Alternately we can easily use
        regular expressions directly or even create our own
        mini-language. There is a simple "mapping file" format
        that can be used. There are no architecture specific
        features (to MVC or whatever). Neither are there any
        framework specific features.""".split()),
